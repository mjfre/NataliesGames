// FINISHED MAY 6TH
  //-Condensed if/else below in square(don’t need to check if(colliding)
  //    and if(!colliding)
  //  -created methods for moveLeft and moveRight in square
  //  -removed canMove variables because the values were never being changed and we can just use ifs to see if it is about to run into trouble
  //  -created a boolean moveRight and moveLeft in the gamePanel class so that we can move the player left and right at a constant speed
  //  -make window width and height variables static so that can be used to create the floor platform
  //  -keep the PFPanel member variable together at the top
  //  -remove the fake floor platform being drawn in drawGameState1
  //  -if you draw the collisionBox from the GameObject class, you will see that there is only one collision box being drawn(left platform)
  //  -get rid of the duplicate initialization of the window jPanel in the platform class
  //  -in checkCollision, make sure you are checking things in relation to an object’s collisionBox, not the object itself
  // -make a boolean for whether the setup has been completed for a level with an if statement in the actionPerformed so that we aren’t redoing that every time we go through
  //     -calling om.setup1
  //     -setting setupComplete = true
  //     -you can also keep the square from falling before the gameState is reached by instantiating your square here and using a setter to set the object manager’s square value
  //     -put your om.update and om.checkCollision that is actionPerformed in an if that checks that the state is not = to T_STATE or E_STATE, otherwise it will try to update the square which isn’t created until the first game state


// CLARIFY
  //  -if there is no collision we want to assign the values of the collision box to the values of x
  //  -move player.draw to objectManager’s draw method


// NEED TO FINISH
  //
  //  -add an else in PFPanel’s keyPressed so that if E is dressed and the state = E_STATE, the state = T_STATE and setup complete = false.
